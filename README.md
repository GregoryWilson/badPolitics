# badPolitics / LegisWatch

Evidence-first legislative monitoring and analysis.

## MVP-1
- Congress.gov bill ingestion
- version preservation + SHA-256 provenance
- section parsing
- deterministic review signals
- version diffing
- local OpenAI-compatible LLM deep dives

## MVP-2
- normalized actions
- sponsor/cosponsor records
- amendment records
- recently-updated federal bill polling
- GovInfo client scaffold
- bill timeline endpoint

## MVP-3A
- evidence entities with stable normalized identity
- bill-to-entity links with exact supporting text
- conservative beneficiary-class extraction
- named-geography extraction
- sponsor/cosponsor entities from Congress.gov
- source-backed entity-to-entity relationships
- one-hop conflict/relationship graph API
- automatic graph sync during bill ingestion

### Evidence semantics

A graph edge is not an accusation. Each edge stores its evidence, source URL, source system, extraction method, and confidence. Deterministic text matches are review leads; official records and imported external datasets can carry higher-confidence relationships.

## MVP-3B
- objective bill metrics instead of political quality scores
- explicit dollar amount counts/sums
- exemptions, retroactivity, grandfathering, enforcement-limit counts
- named geography and beneficiary-class counts
- sponsor/cosponsor/amendment counts
- latest-version change magnitude

## Start
Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add your api.data.gov key, configure the local LLM endpoint, then:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Endpoints

The system extracts review signals and preserves evidence. It does not declare legislation corrupt or politically good/bad. AI explains evidence; source documents establish facts.
